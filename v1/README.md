# A First Experiment with Evidence

I came across [Evidence](https://evidence.dev) while looking a list of YC-backed companies operating out of Canada. 

I'm currently a graduate student pursuing analytics at McGill University. SQL is something that comes a lot more naturally to me as compared to web development, something I haven't played with in a long time.

I absolutely love hearing stories about open-source products but this one has blown it out of the park: the setup was completely hassle-free, and the experience writing just SQL and Markdown whilst creating a webpage/report so minimalistic yet beautiful was seamless.

This is by no means a very BI heavy report: it just analyzes some data on alcohol consumption across the globe. I used it to run some SQL the way I would to crunch metrics using a combination of functions, and created some graphics wherever I could.

Unfortunately, I have not gotten access to Evidence Cloud because of which I haven't been able to publish this yet - however, if interested in taking a look at the SQL code:
The actual file is the `/pages/index.md` [file](https://github.com/inveniam-viam/tinkering-w-evidence/blob/main/v1/pages/index.md).
